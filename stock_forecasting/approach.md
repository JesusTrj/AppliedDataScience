# Approach
The solution will consist of eight main activities, with several task within each one. The following will represent the Minimum Valuable Product (MVP).

1. Data Cleaning & Formatting
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Feature Engineering and selection
4. Compare several machine learning models on a performance metric
5. Perform hyperparameter tuning on the best model
6. Evaluate the best model on the testing set
7. Interpretation
8. Conclutions
